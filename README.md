# Adventure
This is a terminal based game. Your goal is to create your own village and keep it running. You will have to make choices that will affect your village. You will be able to create many villages and keep your kingdom running smoothly!
This game is still in early development and is not *fully* yet playable.

Right now, I've only worked on the tutorial. It is not done yet, but the tutorial will guide you through the basics of the game, but not be annoying. You will be able to skip the tutorial if you want to the game will just be harder.

## Installation
> [!important]
> If you are on Windows, you will need to install the swift tool chain. I recommend the `.exe` version. You don't have to install the C compiler stuff for this to work.
> You can find it [here](https://swift.org/download/). (I hope to fix this one day)
